# Introduction

The Green AI research team develops solutions for people working with data or intersted in data and environment. 

Based on the two articles written by Sébastien Loustau ([1](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03262679v4/document), [2](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03262687v2/document)), we want to extend these results using error bounds to create new algorithms. These algorithms must be a part of the answer to ecological problem like global warming.
Indeed, the Machine Learning and deep learning are more and more popular and easily approachable with new applications every day.
Machine Learning and Deep Learning include the phase of training and inference/prediction. These are really especially consuming in term of energy. Notice that in 2019, the electrical consumption of IT represent more than 3% of the worldwide consumption and increases by 6% per year (The Shift Project 2020, 2021).

For example, a classical model ALexNet has 60 millions of parameters. To realize the measure of consumption, some libraires are already available as *psutil*... We also are implementing our own libraires, find them on [git](https://github.com/GreenAI-Uppa/deep_learning_power_measure).


Many approachs can be done here, for example quantization, pruning or binarization, act directly on the computation of weights by reducing their numbers, by changing their values or by selecting features of interest (lasso).

Using this kind of technics and theorical results, we aim to write new algorithms. You probably already know some light model like bertlight or mobilenet but their main purpose is the efficiency and the bias-variance tradeoff, our point of view is accuracy-energic consumption ratio.

Today we are collaborating with our first industrial partners about projet including climate.
Several prototypes are in progress.
**Prof en Poche** (**ref**) allow us to apply our new model on education data. 
With **Altanoveo**, we are able to developpe climate crisis model. 
FInally, we work with machin to understand farming practices and their CO² emission.
