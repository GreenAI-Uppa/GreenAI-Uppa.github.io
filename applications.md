### REASON 

La chaire [Renewable Energy Age : Social Notices](https://tree.univ-pau.fr/fr/activites-scientifiques/contrats-de-recherche/chaires-2/chaire-reasons.html) aims to analyze the debates surrounding the energy transition. It explores the factors that can encourage societal acceptance, as well as cause its rejection, of different types of renewable energy. In particular, we are implementing the active learning techniques to extract and detect complex concepts in massive harvested datasets from social networks.
