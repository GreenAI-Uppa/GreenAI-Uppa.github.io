Submit your algorithm, and rank yourself according to your energy consumption.

##### What

A specific CIFAR-10 challenge where participants record their energy consumtion in order to optimize the generalization ability of NNs over CIFAR-10 under a given energy budget. 

#### Why 

Unlike previous competitions on specific low power devices to enhance portability on smartphones or raspberry pi embedded in Unmanned vehicles, the idea is to monitor the consumption on standard workstationâ€™s processors and GP-GPU as these are the most commonly used devices and are responsible for the majority of energy consumption and carbon footprint in the AI/deep learning field. 

#### Evaluation

You should supply a docker with your submission, so that we can run it on our server. 

For each slice of accuracy, the best algorithm will be promoted
95\%, 99\% 

The [https://github.com/GreenAI-Uppa/IAPowerMeter](IA Power Meter) will be used to measure the amount of energy used by the program inference. You can already use it to check how good you are.
