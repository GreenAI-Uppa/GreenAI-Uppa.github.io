Description of the industrial projects

### Crisis management

## Our research

![seminar4](/images/seminar4.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Our research encompasses diverse projects and collaborations around the mathematical foundations of power-efficient deep/machine learning algorithms, and the applications of AI to build a more sustainable world. In this section, we present the mathematical as well as the algorithmic part of our activity. 

### Our algorithms 

Deep Learning has become extremely popular to solve many supervised machine learning problems. This standardization of machine learning, namely computing on GPU a stochastic gradient descent is not only a plague for science but also a disaster in terms of power consumption. Recently, a growing interest is observed in the deep learning hype in order to reduce computational cost by designing lighter architectures. Several approaches for reducing the computational effort of NNs have been proposed (e.g. binarized networks or pruning methods). Moreover, promising strategies propose to select the connectivity of the network, or more generally the architecture, during the training process. 

 GreenAI Uppa expect to address these issues, based on both a theoretical and practical machine/deep learning analysis of standard pipeline and new paradigms. More precisely, we propose alternatives to standard deep learning pipeline in order to rethink the learning process and show how deep mathematical statistics could help us to select lighter algorithms and reduce training, inference complexity and environmental impact of machine learning.

### Measure the hungriness of your deep learning

We are also mainly focus on more a practical study of recent architectures in terms of power consumption, by using recent softwares like RAPL and nvidia-smi in a dedicated software available here. Gathering with a mathematical background, we have the long term objective to design adaptive architectura that fits dynamically to the size of the data, the difficulty of the problem and the desire environmental constraints.

 - **September, 27th 2021 - S√©bastien Loustau (UPPA)** Introduction to convex optimization
Summary : In this lecture, I will introduce convex optimization theory and mirror descent. We start with a theoretical motivation and studyt of (stochastic) gradient descent, and then moove to the non-euclidean setting to derive mirror descent algorithm as a generalization of gradient descent. We finally apply it to the context of expert advices to recover the classical regret bound for exponential weighted averages previously presented in the first seminar in july, and discuss possible applications to Green AI.

 - **September, 13th 2021 - S√©bastien Loustau (UPPA)** Kick Off Green AI Uppa
Summary : Official kick off of the Green AI Uppa project ! After presenting the climatic and mathematical motivations (has the earth ever been this hot before ?), we introduce the context and support we have from the public institutions and the SMEs. We explain how the team will be organized, and inspired from the best of both worlds. Then we take 30 minuts to write our **elevator pitch**. Welcome to Jordy and Matthieu !

 - **August, 23th 2021 - Paul Gay (UPPA)** Measuring the Power draw of computers
Summary : The ability of measuring power and consumption of machine learning algorithms is necessary to design new efficient ones. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the machine learning and IT community for measuring the consumption at different scale, from the AI model to the entire data center. In this talk, we survey recent tools and softwares based on RAPL and NVIDIA-SMI and highlight the dependancy to the hardware considered (CPU, GPU), as well as the different sources of consumption in the architecture of a computer. The final goal is to give to engineers and data scientists the capacity to measure the consumption of deep/machine learning algorithms via our open source software [deep_learning_power_measure](https://github.com/GreenAI-Uppa/deep_learning_power_measure) developed by Green AI Uppa.

 - **July, 26th 2021 - Julien Mercier (UPPA)** How to binarize a neural network ?
Summary : In this talk, I propose to present the main pros and cons of binarization via the gradient. We present two main historical attempt: [BinaryConnect](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363) and [BinaryNetwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830), based on two recent papers.

 - **July, 5th 2021 - S√©bastien Loustau** Comment int√©grer des contraintes environnementales dans les algorithmes de Deep Learning ?
R√©sum√© : Dans cet expos√©, je vous propose d'introduire la th√©orie PAC-Bayesienne et son lien avec la th√©orie des jeux pour proposer de nouvelles proc√©dures d'apprentissage s√©quentiel. Apr√®s une introduction simple du probl√®me de pr√©vision avec avis d'experts, on pr√©sentera des in√©galit√©s PAC-Bayesiennes plus g√©n√©rales et des bornes de regrets parcimonieuses pour des famillles de r√©seaux de neurones particuli√®res (XNOR-nets notamment). Enfin, on proposera une extension de cette th√©orie au Transport Optimal pour int√©grer de nouvelles p√©nalit√©s plus g√©n√©riques et garantir l'int√©gration de mesures de consommations plus pr√©cises.
Cet expos√© est une introduction aux principales motivations de ces articles : Learning with BOT et Sparsity regret bounds for XNOR-Nets

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
