The GreenAI UPPA team is an engaged lab that improves state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Concerned with our impact on earth, we develop low consumption algorithms and tackle environmental challenges. Unlike other research groups, our activities are dedicated to the full pipeline from the math grounding to R&D prototype and in production deployment with industrial partners. We are based in Pau, France, in front of the Pyrénées. 

## Our research

![mirrordescent](/images/seminar4.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Our research encompasses diverse projects and collaborations around the mathematical foundations of power-efficient deep/machine learning algorithms, and the applications of AI to build a more sustainable world. In this section, we present the mathematical as well as the algorithmic part of our activity. 

### Theory and algorithms 

Deep Learning has become extremely popular to solve many supervised machine learning problems. This standardization of machine learning, namely computing on GPU a stochastic gradient descent is not only a plague for science but also a disaster in terms of power consumption. Recently, a growing interest is observed in the deep learning hype in order to reduce computational cost by designing lighter architectures. Several approaches for reducing the computational effort of NNs have been proposed (e.g. binarized networks or pruning methods). Moreover, promising strategies propose to select the connectivity of the network, or more generally the architecture, during the training process. 

 GreenAI UPPA expects to address these issues, based on both a theoretical and practical machine/deep learning analysis of standard pipeline and new paradigms. More precisely, we propose alternatives to standard deep learning pipelines in order to rethink the learning process and show how mathematical statistics could help us to select lighter algorithms and reduce training, inference complexity and environmental impact of machine learning.

**Measure the hungriness of your deep learning**: We measure the power consumption of recent architectures on different hardwares through our [AIPowerMeter](https://github.com/GreenAI-Uppa/deep_learning_power_measure) based on RAPL and nvidia-smi.

    Children Speech Recognition system in a classroom context with energy consumption consideration.
  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> Speech recognition is a complex subject that requires attention to many points during implementation depending on the use case. The choice of architecture, the data collection, their use but also the energy consumed during training are all points addressed during this seminar. Within the project with the startup Prof en Poche, we will see a solution using DeepSpeech which aims to recognize children's voices in the classroom answering mathematical games. This solution comes with a dashboard to display and compare several models via their parameters, data used, energy consumption and especially according to their results. We will see how we were able to obtain up to 18% WER (Word Error Rate) and 12% CER (Character Error Rate) on our target data.

    <b>&#8226; March 2022, the 21st</b>, upcoming seminar of <a href='https://tree.univ-pau.fr/fr/index.html'>TREE lab</a> by Romain Carrausse, Contestations, conceptions and modes of government of ecological modernization. A reading from a political geography based on the cases of agrivolatism and energy communities.
  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> Romain Carrausse is a post-doctoral fellow at the TEEN research chair and contributes to SoWeSI, a research project conducted in partnership between the company Total Energies and the UPPA.  He is working on how ecological modernization is governed and contested at different scales and on different objects. Two works in progress will be presented. The first is on agrivoltaics: a production system that combines energy production, using photovoltaic panels, and agriculture on the same plot of land. We will discuss how the energy sector legitimizes this innovation through a process of internalization of the criticism and demonstration of the agro-economic benefits of the shade produced by the photovoltaic panels. The second is about energy communities. In a context where renewable energy projects face numerous oppositions, locally governed projects, grouped under the term energy community, are experiencing a social and political dynamic in France. A multiscalar approach will be used to analyze the strategies and concepts of energy transition that are reflected in the institutionalization and growth of energy communities.

  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> Crisis management requires the management of a large amount of heterogeneous information. This seminar focuses on the processing of media (TV news, tweets), whose monitoring is crucial for decision makers to understand the perception of a crisis by the general public.

It will be presented first efforts to build a monitoring system: (i) open-source libraries are used to extract speech and text embedded in videos (ii) Named-Entity Recognition is applied to bring a summary of the information to a human operator.

In particular, an important issue is the construction of a model able to detect concepts appearing during the crisis and thus unknown to the model at the time of learning.

We will study three complementary strategies based on regular expressions, word embedding comparisons and a BERT model learned online as training data arrives.

    <b>Abstract:</b> The ability of measuring power and consumption of machine learning algorithms is necessary to design new efficient ones. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the machine learning and IT community for measuring the consumption at different scale, from the AI model to the entire data center. In this talk, we survey recent tools and softwares based on RAPL and NVIDIA-SMI and highlight the dependancy to the hardware considered (CPU, GPU), as well as the different sources of consumption in the architecture of a computer. The final goal is to give to engineers and data scientists the capacity to measure the consumption of deep/machine learning algorithms via our open source software <a href="https://github.com/GreenAI-Uppa/deep_learning_power_measure">deep_learning_power_measure</a> developed by Green AI Uppa.

  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> In this talk, I propose to introduce the main theoretical foundations of online learning and PAC-Bayesian theory and how it could be used to build new power-efficient algorithms. After a gentle start dedicated to the problem of prediction with expert's advices, I will present the PAC-Bayesian paradigm and how it is related to the context of aggregation of expert's advices and stochastic algorithms. We apply this theory to learn sparse deep nets where the networks are coming from recent advances in binarization (BinaryConnect, XNor-nets, Xnor-nets ++). We finally sketch how to generalize these results to more suitable divergences such as Optimal Transport, a nice and promising field in order to measure the cost of choosing sequentially a particular algorithm in terms of electric consumption. This talk is based on the two following papers: <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03262687/document">Learning with BOT</a> and <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03262679v3/document">Sparsity regret bounds for XNOR-Nets</a>.

### Training

We have a long experience in creating training content on machine learning and deep learning towards student and industrial learners. 

## Industrial projects

We also collaborate with industrial partners to tackle new scientific challenges. These contrats allow to grant new research programs between SMEs and University in one of these two directions: 
 (1) the design of embedded and light AI algorithms or 
 (2) the application of AI for environment purpose.

### Crisis management

[Altanoveo](https://www.cwall.fr/en/) is specialised in very high resolution visualization and has developped for 10 years **CWall**, a high resolution collaborative software solution designed to be deployed on video walls.
CWall is multi-site, multi-source and multi-application. It offers real-time collaboration among people working in the same room or remotely by sharing thier computer screens, video streams,  web application and so on. 
CWall shows its full potential for : 

- joint study of resources at a very high resolution across a wide range of disciplines, 
- simultaneous display of several streams and information into different windows, particularly in crisis management or monitoring situations.

Our main purpose is to integrate AI on Cwall in order to index the vast amount of information encountered crisis.

Based on low consumption algorithms, this project start with an analysis of social networks and open source data as climate crisis images. Being able to summarize open informations and foresee their impact will be a perfect addition upgrade to CWall.

### AI for Education

The start-up [ProfenPoche](https://profenpoche.com/) was founded in 2015 by Vincent Escudé, Paul Escudé and Samuel Imbert. 
It is specialized in creation on new numerical educative solutions and more specifically, propose to provide a teacher to a needed student using smartphone, tablet or computer. They created **Mathia** using AI as a innovative product in order to give the love of mathematics to children. In 2019, they were rewarded for Mathia as laureate of P2IA (Partenariat d’Innovation en Intelligence Artificielle) launched by the Ministère de l'Education Nationale et de la Jeunesse.

Mathia is an app which recommands educational material to children. The recommendation is powered by a clustering performed on the children profile and which includes their skills and personal difficulties. Our goal is to improve these tasks and reduce the consumption of energies.

### Computer vision and Hydrobiology

[Hizkia Informatique](https://www.hizkia.eu/) is an IT services company. Her experience in computer and video applications for hydrobiology began with INRA (French national institute for agronomic research) more than 15 years ago.
Hizkia designs all its products: hardware and software. It does software development and the installation and maintenance of equipment. Hizkia also has 30 years’ experience in industrial service.

Hizkia has designed a **video-counting device for fish passage**. In the current version, operators have to watch the videos to note the species of fish and their size. Our purpose is to have the videos processed by an AI that would be able to recognize the species of fish, count and measure them automatically. This application of Computer Vision to biodiversity monitoring contains next level challenges : object tracking from frame to frame, denoising images, correct lighting and species labels, and tackle problems of quantization and selection of high resolutions images and videos.

### Improving bee health and pollination

Mellisphera is building data-driven solutions for hive monitoring and pollination management. Founded in 2018, the company offers to beekeepers and growers, tools and algorithms to assess in real time colony health, colony dynamics and pollination activity.

The main benefits of this technology are:
-  Efficient beekeeper’s operations: A constant information stream about the colony health allows for focused actions with the appropriate hardware and at the right time. Savings in time and fuel are significant with a typical ROI < 12 month
-  Lower honeybee mortality rates: A real time alerts system allows beekeepers to be warned when it’s still time for action. We aim reducing mortality from 30% to 10%.
-  Improved pollination and yield: 75% of the fruits we eat are pollinator dependent at some extent. Good pollination is essential for growers achieve yield and quality. Mellisphera monitors pollination on kiwi, sunflower and apple yards. 

Our challenge is to improve beekeeping practices by offering predictive tools that are at the same time accurate and scalable over different regions and countries. To achieve this goal, we are relying on mechanistic and AI powered models. They are developed in our research apiaries as in those from multiple beekeepers contributing around the world. We are partnering with [Broodminder](www.broodminder.com) into a global team with the shared ambition to offer one of the best-in-class solutions.
