## The team

The GreenAI UPPA team is an engaged lab that improves state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Concerned with our impact on earth, we develop low consumption algorithms and tackle environmental challenges. Unlike other research groups, our activities are dedicated to the full pipeline from the math grounding to R&D prototype and in production deployment with industrial partners. We are based in Pau, France, in front of the Pyrénées.

## Our research

![mirrordescent](/images/seminar4.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Our research encompasses diverse projects and collaborations around the mathematical foundations of power-efficient deep/machine learning algorithms, and the applications of AI to build a more sustainable world. In this section, we present the mathematical as well as the algorithmic part of our activity.

## Team members

We wish to bring together different people from different communities but with one share commitment: take collective actions on the world's greatest crisis and build a safe and healthy planet for the next generations.
