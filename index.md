excerpt: "The GreenAI UPPA team is an engaged lab that improves state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Concerned with our impact on earth, we develop low consumption algorithms and tackle environmental challenges."
aside: true

We are convinced that today’s world, based on the unwavering belief in technological solutions only, will not last, and therefore the need to develop the necessary perspective when developing, designing, or studying artificial intelligence solutions.

## The team

The greenAI Uppa team has been split in 2022. Most of its members are still working on sustainability and machine learning in the south west of France. This page will keep on updating news of GreenAI in the region of Pau and around.

This page is under construction and will be updated to highlights GreenAI related initiatives around University of Pau and CY-Tech university.

## Our research

![mirrordescent](/images/seminar4.png){:class="img-responsive"}

This page is dedicated to topics linking AI with environment. According to the Afnor organism, this corresponds to 

- The need to use an AI system rather than another less energy-intensive solution to achieve the same objective has been demonstrated;

- Best practices are adopted by the producer, supplier, and customer to reduce the environmental impacts of the service using an AI algorithm;

-  Uses and needs are aimed at remaining within planetary boundaries and have been previously questioned.

## Team members

We wish to bring together different people from different communities but with one share commitment: take collective actions on the world's greatest crisis and build a safe and healthy planet for the next generations.

### Sébastien Loustau

<img src="images/sebastien.png" align="center" width="200"/>
After a PHD thesis defended in 2008, at [Institut de Marseille](https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr) Sebastien worked as Associated professor at [Université d'Angers](https://www.univ-angers.fr/fr/index.html) in the lab [LAREMA](https://math.univ-angers.fr/LAREMA/) where he defended his Habilitation thesis in 2014.
He found the AI start-up [LumeanAI](https://www.lumenai.fr/) in 2015 and the non-profit organization [IAPau](http://www.iapau.fr/) in 2016.
In 2020, he is researcher at the [LMAP](https://lma-umr5142.univ-pau.fr/fr/index.html) at [Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour](https://www.univ-pau.fr/fr/index.html) and created the GreenAI UPPA Group.
He is now investigating social aspects in agriculture practices, notably the links between sufficiency, resilience, and how focusing on performance can lead to a vulnerable society.

### Paul Gay

<img src="images/paul.png" align="center" width="200"/>
 Paul obtained his phd between [LIUM](https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/) in France and  [IDIAP Reshearch Institut](https://www.idiap.ch/en) in Switzerland in 2014 on unsupervised Audio-visual person identification in news video. Then, he went through a teaching period at the [LIA](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/) (2015) a Post-doc in computer vision, at [IIT/PAVIS](https://pavis.iit.it/) (2016 - 2018), and worked at the [LumenAI](https://www.lumenai.fr/) on community detection (2019 - 2020). He is currently researcher at the [ETIS](https://www.etis-lab.fr/) working on environmental and social consequences of AI, by building monitoring tools and running qualitative studies.

### Nicolas Tirel

<img src="images/nicolas.png" align="center" width="220"/>
Nicolas graduated from the engineering school [CYTech](https://www.linkedin.com/school/cy-tech/) (ex-EISTI) at Pau, France in 2021 with a speciality in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. He is passionated about Data Science since he went to Taïwan for an Exchange Semester during his school time. Thus, he decided to join GreenAI UPPA team on a project about two fields that are really meaningful for him : education and environment. He is currently doing a Phd with the [Liuppa laboratory](https://liuppa.univ-pau.fr) and university of Zaragossa. His research focus on techniques for deploying computing tasks on servers to reduce the carbon footprint of digital services.

He also facilitates scientific collective intelligence workshops to raise environmental awareness, focusing on climate, biodiversity, and digital issues, within the @Baskula association, in order to understand the challenges and levers for action in favor of a more sustainable and just world.
