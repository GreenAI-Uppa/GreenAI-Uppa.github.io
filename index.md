## Our research

![seminar4](/images/seminar4.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Our research encompasses diverse projects and collaborations around the mathematical foundations of power-efficient deep/machine learning algorithms, and the applications of AI to build a more sustainable world. In this section, we present the mathematical as well as the algorithmic part of our activity. 

### Our algorithms 

Deep Learning has become extremely popular to solve many supervised machine learning problems. This standardization of machine learning, namely computing on GPU a stochastic gradient descent is not only a plague for science but also a disaster in terms of power consumption. Recently, a growing interest is observed in the deep learning hype in order to reduce computational cost by designing lighter architectures. Several approaches for reducing the computational effort of NNs have been proposed (e.g. binarized networks or pruning methods). Moreover, promising strategies propose to select the connectivity of the network, or more generally the architecture, during the training process. 

 GreenAI Uppa expect to address these issues, based on both a theoretical and practical machine/deep learning analysis of standard pipeline and new paradigms. More precisely, we propose alternatives to standard deep learning pipeline in order to rethink the learning process and show how deep mathematical statistics could help us to select lighter algorithms and reduce training, inference complexity and environmental impact of machine learning.

### Measure the hungriness of your deep learning

We are also mainly focus on more a practical study of recent architectures in terms of power consumption, by using recent softwares like RAPL and nvidia-smi in a dedicated software available here. Gathering with a mathematical background, we have the long term objective to design adaptive architectura that fits dynamically to the size of the data, the difficulty of the problem and the desire environmental constraints.

## Sponsors

This project is mainly supported by the I-Site E2S-UPPA, a french consortium composed of [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/), [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/), [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/) that assists companies and public organizations in their energy and environmental transition.

Partnerships with public institutions, as well as SMEs are one of the main motivations for the existence of GreenAI Uppa.

### As a Jekyll theme

1. Add `gem "alembic-jekyll-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the theme and its dependancies
3. Add `theme: alembic-jekyll-theme` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site
5. Done! Use the [configuration](#configuration) documentation and the example [`_config.yml`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_config.yml) file to set things like the navigation, contact form and social sharing buttons

### As a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add `gem "jekyll-remote-theme"` to your `Gemfile` to add the theme as a dependancy
2. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
3. Add `jekyll-remote-theme` to the list of `plugins` in your `_config.yml` file
4. Add `remote_theme: daviddarnes/alembic@main` to your `_config.yml` file to set the site theme

### As a Boilerplate / Fork

_(deprecated, not recommended)_

1. [Fork the repo](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic#fork-destination-box)
2. Replace the `Gemfile` with one stating all the gems used in your project
3. Delete the following unnecessary files/folders: `.github`, `LICENSE`, `screenshot.png`, `CNAME` and `alembic-jekyll-theme.gemspec`
4. Run the command `bundle install` in the root of project to install the jekyll remote theme gem as a dependancy
5. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build and serve your site

## Customising

When using Alembic as a theme means you can take advantage of the file overriding method. This allows you to overwrite any file in this theme with your own custom file, by matching the file name and path. The most common example of this would be if you want to add your own styles or change the core style settings.

To add your own styles copy the [`styles.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/assets/styles.scss) into your own project with the same file path (`assets/styles.scss`). From there you can add your own styles, you can even optionally ignore the theme styles by removing the `@import "alembic";` line.

If you're looking to set your own colours and fonts you can overwrite them by matching the variable names from the [`_settings.scss`](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_sass/_settings.scss) file in your own `styles.scss`, make sure to state them before the `@import "alembic";` line so they take effect. The settings are a mixture of custom variables and settings from [Sassline](https://medium.com/@jakegiltsoff/sassline-v2-0-e424b2881e7e) - follow the link to find out how to configure the typographic settings.
