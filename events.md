    <b>Abstract:</b> 
    Deep Learning have historically shown success in Speech processing, then tremendous impact on Vision, and eventually on textual data. These models contains many assumptions which are linked to the properties of the data they are applied on (eg. euclidean grid spaces for images). On the other side, many interesting problems can be approach with a graph modelisation, in which these assumptions are no longer valid. In this talk, I wil provide an overview of the last 5 year advancement to apply deep learning principles to learn on graphs.

## Reading group

Our reading group meets quaterly and provides foundations and up-to-date information on topics in power-efficient deep learning, mathematical statistics and optimization. We give participants valuable experience in leading group discussions and share state-of-the-art machine learning. For each session, papers are assigned in advance, and one to two participant guide the discussion.
