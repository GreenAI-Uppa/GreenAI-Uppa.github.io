    <b>&#8226; June, 20th 2022 - Sébastien Loustau & Lorette Duris</b>, team member. Introduction to the agro-ecological transition and the MSV (Cultivation on living soil, Maraîchage sur Sols Vivants in french)
  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> 

Agriculture is an essential lever for action in the face of the transformations we are experiencing. The MSV (Maraîchage sur Sols Vivants) is a set of practices of the Agriculture of the living which consists in feeding the soil with organic matter (with high C/N) to support the biodiversity of the soil, and an organic ploughing of the earthworms. After an introduction to MSV, I will describe the status of the 'From Soil to Plate' project, which aims to lead a positive impact project within the university by developing technical and social innovations in favor of these environmentally virtuous practices. Finally, Lorette will explain her work in biochemistry, which consists in analyzing the soils (organic matter rate, ph in particular) and vegetables (dry matter) of different producers from three types of agriculture: conventional, organic and MSV.
