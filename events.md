    <b>&#8226; June, 13th 2022 - Paul Gay</b>, team member. Early Exit Yolo for object detection in videos.

  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> 
The large amount of computation required for video processing can be drastically reduced by eliminating redundant information present in successive images and by using light AI models (quantization, pruning, distillation).
In this line, this seminar describes the potential of "Early Exit" which allows to adapt the amount of computation to the difficulty of the image to be analyzed.
On the one hand, trivial images can be quickly discarded, and on the other hand, computations performed on complex images can be reused to shorten the processing time of the following images. The seminar will have as experimental framework the use of the YoloV5 model for object detection.

    <b>&#8226; June, 20th 2022 - Sébastien Loustau & Lorette Duris</b>, team member. Introduction to the agro-ecological transition and the MSV (Cultivation on living soil, Maraîchage sur Sols Vivants in french)
  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b> 

Agriculture is an essential lever for action in the face of the transformations we are experiencing. The MSV (Maraîchage sur Sols Vivants) is a set of practices of the Agriculture of the living which consists in feeding the soil with organic matter (with high C/N) to support the biodiversity of the soil, and an organic ploughing of the earthworms. After an introduction to MSV, I will describe the status of the 'From Soil to Plate' project, which aims to lead a positive impact project within the university by developing technical and social innovations in favor of these environmentally virtuous practices. Finally, Lorette will explain her work in biochemistry, which consists in analyzing the soils (organic matter rate, ph in particular) and vegetables (dry matter) of different producers from three types of agriculture: conventional, organic and MSV.

## Reading group

Our reading group meets quaterly and provides foundations and up-to-date information on topics in power-efficient deep learning, mathematical statistics and optimization. We give participants valuable experience in leading group discussions and share state-of-the-art machine learning. For each session, papers are assigned in advance, and one to two participant guide the discussion.
