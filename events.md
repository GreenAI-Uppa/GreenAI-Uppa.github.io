    <b>&#8226; October, 17th 2022 - Simon Lebeaud, team member.</b><br>A review of state of the art tracking and object detection
  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    From calculating euclidean distance to deep appearance metrics association, state of the art tracking techniques changed quite a lot in the past decade. Evolving in parallel to object detection and relying a lot on it, tracking techniques are trying to solve the association between object states while coping with the sometimes unreliable detections.
