    <b>Abstract:</b> Early Exit Yolo for object detection in videos

The large amount of computation required for video processing can be drastically reduced by eliminating redundant information present in successive images and by using light AI models (quantization, pruning, distillation).
In this line, this seminar describes the potential of "Early Exit" which allows to adapt the amount of computation to the difficulty of the image to be analyzed.
On the one hand, trivial images can be quickly discarded, and on the other hand, computations performed on complex images can be reused to shorten the processing time of the following images. The seminar will have as experimental framework the use of the YoloV5 model for object detection.

## Reading group

Our reading group meets quaterly and provides foundations and up-to-date information on topics in power-efficient deep learning, mathematical statistics and optimization. We give participants valuable experience in leading group discussions and share state-of-the-art machine learning. For each session, papers are assigned in advance, and one to two participant guide the discussion.
