    <br><b>Title: </b>Event Detection and Uncertainty, a crisis management context
    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  The confidence of a model in its predictions is essential for it to be robust and for its interpretation. After a brief retrospective on the integration of our MedIA tool into Cwall, a state of the art on Active Learning methods and Uncertainty Measures will be presented in a context of event detection. Motivated by a fine annotation of our data, we will then discuss unsupervised methods. Finally, we will discuss our first measurements on crisis datasets using the fine-tuning of the BLOOM model [BigScience].

    <br><b>Title: </b>Advances in trash detection project: presentation of YOLOv7 and methods for addressing class imbalance
    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  In order to propose an immersive awareness solution by putting digital, AI and user experience at the service of the environmental cause, we are implementing a real-time trash detection system to raise awareness about recycling in schools. During the previous seminar on this topic, we showed the first results obtained with the object detection model YOLOv5 on our training dataset made of images of trash taken in nature.  To improve these results and to add in our system the possibility to have the mask of the found object, we experimented the new version of YOLO (YOLOV7), the fastest and most accurate real time object detection model at the moment.  The following seminar presents the different optimizations brought to this new version of YOLO and some methods used to address the problem of class imbalance in a dataset.

  <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    We develop the role of environmental imaginaries (wilderness, "Eldorado", etc) for biodiversity conservation in Amazon rainforest, its interrelation with international public opinion and the resulting conflicts of representation between diverse populations ("determined territory" vs "territory prescribed"). Ultimately, it will be question of technology and biodiversity conservation. We think about the possibilities of empowerment that technology offers to reduce this dichotomy and their contributions of co-constructed and objectifying information

  <p>
    During the previous seminar, we presented an ASR for children in a classroom context to learn mathematics using their voices.
    We used at this time DeepSpeech, an open-source implementation developed by Mozilla and inspired by the Silicon Valley AI Lab, with a result of 18% in WER.
    Since that, we have changed DeepSpeech to Coqui STT, adapt the corpus with a more realistic one and designed a specific language model to get even better results.
    The following seminar will go through our journey, with a more spontaneous dataset and a lighter model.

  </summary>
  <p>
    Deep Learning have historically shown success in Speech processing, then tremendous impact on Vision, and eventually on textual data. These models contains many assumptions which are linked to the properties of the data they are applied on (eg. euclidean grid spaces for images). On the other side, many interesting problems can be approach with a graph modelisation, in which these assumptions are no longer valid. In this talk, I wil provide an overview of the last 5 year advancement to apply deep learning principles to learn on graphs.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
Agriculture is an essential lever for action in the face of the transformations we are experiencing. The MSV (Maraîchage sur Sols Vivants) is a set of practices of the Agriculture of the living which consists in feeding the soil with organic matter (with high C/N) to support the biodiversity of the soil, and an organic ploughing of the earthworms. After an introduction to MSV, I will describe the status of the 'From Soil to Plate' project, which aims to lead a positive impact project within the university by developing technical and social innovations in favor of these environmentally virtuous practices. Finally, Lorette will explain her work in biochemistry, which consists in analyzing the soils (organic matter rate, ph in particular) and vegetables (dry matter) of different producers from three types of agriculture: conventional, organic and MSV.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    The massive amount of computation required to process video can be largely reduced by discarding redundant information in nearby frames and relying on light AI (quantification, pruning, distillation). In this line, this seminar advocate the potential of Early Exit which enable to dynamically adapt the amount of computation to the difficulty of the detection in each image. On one hand, trivial images can be quickly discarded, and the computation budget can be spent on building good features for hard cases, which will be reused for the next frames. 
This seminar presents an implementation of these ideas with YOLOv5 on video object detection.

  <p>
    Crisis management requires the processing of a large amount of heterogeneous information in particular audiovisual streams coming from media and social networks. This seminar follows a first part focused on the presentation of open-source models for audio, image, and text analysis. The practical application of these methods will be the basis of this presentation. We will first go back to the motivations for such a process. Then, we will discuss the global architecture adopted with a comparative assessment of methods evaluated on the REPERE annotated data corpus [Giraudel et al]. Finally, we will conclude with a demonstration of a first prototype allowing us to observe and summarize in real-time a news flow.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Romain Carrausse is a post-doctoral fellow at the TEEN research chair and contributes to SoWeSI, a research project conducted in partnership between the company Total Energies and the UPPA.  He is working on how ecological modernization is governed and contested at different scales and on different objects. Two works in progress will be presented. The first is on agrivoltaics: a production system that combines energy production, using photovoltaic panels, and agriculture on the same plot of land. We will discuss how the energy sector legitimizes this innovation through a process of internalization of the criticism and demonstration of the agro-economic benefits of the shade produced by the photovoltaic panels. The second is about energy communities. In a context where renewable energy projects face numerous oppositions, locally governed projects, grouped under the term energy community, are experiencing a social and political dynamic in France. A multiscalar approach will be used to analyze the strategies and concepts of energy transition that are reflected in the institutionalization and growth of energy communities.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Crisis management requires the management of a large amount of heterogeneous information. This seminar focuses on the processing of media (TV news, tweets), whose monitoring is crucial for decision makers to understand the perception of a crisis by the general public.

It will be presented first efforts to build a monitoring system: (i) open-source libraries are used to extract speech and text embedded in videos (ii) Named-Entity Recognition is applied to bring a summary of the information to a human operator.

In particular, an important issue is the construction of a model able to detect concepts appearing during the crisis and thus unknown to the model at the time of learning.

We will study three complementary strategies based on regular expressions, word embedding comparisons and a BERT model learned online as training data arrives.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    In this talk, I will introduce alternatives to standard gradient descents to learn power-efficient deep learning algorithms. After a gentle start about optimization with mirror descents,  we present recent theoretical advances on Pac-Bayesian sparse deep learning, leading to a new greedy optimizer to learn sparse and potentially binarized deep networks. We finally introduce new divergences to the prior, and rely this framework with metric task systems.

    <b>&#8226; November, 8th 2021 - Jordy Palafox, former team member.</b><br> Adaptive Learning and Clustering methods
    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    In the context of adaptive learning, clustering methods are used to recognize students with the same profil. Here, we will focus on the clustering algorithm used by Prof en Poche which is a combinaison of two methods : the KMedoids and the Louvain algorithm to obtain a robust method. After introducing it, we will measure the consumption of the algorithm and explore how to reduce it. We will conclude with some recent methods using deep learning based on autoencoders.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    As transformers are becoming the standard NLP tool, questions are raised about ethics, bias and energy consumption. This last topic is of importance as these models are the biggest ones in the large and hungry power deep learning model trend. In this seminar, I will present in the first part a conmprehensive tutorial on the principles of attention and how the transformers have conquered the state of the art. This details will equip us for the second part in which I will survey a number of methods which are concerned in making the transformers lighter and more available for practicionners with low computation resources.</p>

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    In this lecture, I will introduce convex optimization theory and mirror descent. We start with a theoretical motivation and studyt of (stochastic) gradient descent, and then moove to the non-euclidean setting to derive mirror descent algorithm as a generalization of gradient descent. We finally apply it to the context of expert advices to recover the classical regret bound for exponential weighted averages previously presented in the first seminar in july, and discuss   possible applications to Green AI.

    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    The ability of measuring power and consumption of machine learning algorithms is necessary to design new efficient ones. Nowadays, there is a growing interest in the machine learning and IT community for measuring the consumption at different scale, from the AI model to the entire data center. In this talk, we survey recent tools and softwares based on RAPL and NVIDIA-SMI and highlight the dependancy to the hardware considered (CPU, GPU), as well as the different sources of consumption in the architecture of a computer. The final goal is to give to engineers and data scientists the capacity to measure the consumption of deep/machine learning algorithms via our open source software <a href="https://github.com/GreenAI-Uppa/deep_learning_power_measure">deep_learning_power_measure</a> developed by Green AI Uppa.

    <b>&#8226; July, 5th 2021 - Sébastien Loustau, team member.</b><br><b>Title: </b>How to penalize deep learning with power measurements ?
    <br><b><a style="cursor: pointer">Abstract:</a></b>
  </summary>
  <p>
    In this talk, I propose to introduce the main theoretical foundations of online learning and PAC-Bayesian theory and how it could be used to build new power-efficient algorithms. After a gentle start dedicated to the problem of prediction with expert's advices, I will present the PAC-Bayesian paradigm and how it is related to the context of aggregation of expert's advices and stochastic algorithms. We apply this theory to learn sparse deep nets where the networks are coming from recent advances in binarization (BinaryConnect, XNor-nets, Xnor-nets ++). We finally sketch how to generalize these results to more suitable divergences such as Optimal Transport, a nice and promising field in order to measure the cost of choosing sequentially a particular algorithm in terms of electric consumption. This talk is based on the two following papers: <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03262687/document">Learning with BOT</a> and <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03262679v3/document">Sparsity regret bounds for XNOR-Nets</a>.
