    <b>&#8226; October, 3rd 2022 - Nicolas Tirel</b>. Advances in ASR for schoolchildren
  </summary>
  <p>
    <b>Abstract:</b>
    During the previous seminar, we designed an ASR for children in a classroom context to make them answer some serious games to learn mathematics.
    We used at this time DeepSpeech, an open-source implementation developed by Mozilla and inspired by the Silicon Valley AI Lab, with a result of 18% in WER.
    Since that, we have changed DeepSpeech to coqui, adapt the corpus with a more realistic one and designed a specific language model to get even better results.
    The following seminar will go through our journey, with a more spontaneous dataset and a lighter model.
