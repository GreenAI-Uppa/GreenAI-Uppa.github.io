Measure of consumption, light environmental impact, in this workshop, we expect to address these issues, based on both a theoretical and practical deep learning analysis of
standard pipeline and new paradigms. Join us to discover how energy hungry your deep learning is, and join the competition to improve it.



## Program:

**6:00 am (UTC)**
### Introduction on Low Power deep learning 

<img src="../images/sebastien.png" align="center" width="200"/>

**Bio** After a PHD thesis defended in 2008, at Institut de Marseille Sebastien worked as Associated professor at Université d’Angers in the lab LAREMA where he defended his Habilitation thesis in 2014. He found the AI start-up LumeanAI in 2015 and the non-profit organization IAPau in 2016. Since 2020, he is researcher at the LMAP at UPPA and found with Paul Gay the GreenAi UPPA Group. His research interest are online learning, mathematical statistics, information theory for machine learning and more recently, in the applications of these activities to deep learning techniques and environmental challenges.

Johannes Lederer

**Bio** Johannes is Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the Ruhr-University Bochum. After receiving a MSc in Physics, he completed his Doctor of Sciences at ETH Zürich. He then held positions at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and University of Washington prior to his appointment in Bochum. His research interests include high-dimensional statistics, empirical process theory, and deep learning.

Guillaume Bellec

**bio** Guillaume Bellec develops theories to advance our under-standing of brains and intelligent machines. He studied artificial intelligence during his Master in Paris and he completed his PhD with Wolfgang Maass in the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science of TU Graz in Austria. He is now a postdoc with Wulfram Gerstner in the Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience at EPFL in Switzerland. His work is most well-known for showing that powerful artificial intelligence can emerge from simple mathematical models of biologically realistic neural networks. This work is having a direct impact on the development of neuromorphic-hardware for energy efficient artificial intelligence applications.

Green AI Team Tutorial: Energy consumption of AI

**bio** Paul Gay is a researcher engineer at the LMAP. He obtained his phd at the université of maine (https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/) in 2014 on unsupervised Audio-visual person identification in broadcast data. Then, he went through a teaching period at the [LIA](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/) (2015) a Post-doc in computer vision, at [IIT/PAVIS](https://pavis.iit.it/) (2016 - 2018), and worked at the [LumenAI](https://www.lumenai.fr/) on community detection (2019 - 2020).
