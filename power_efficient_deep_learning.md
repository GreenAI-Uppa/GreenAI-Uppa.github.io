Measure of consumption, light environmental impact, in this workshop, we expect to address these issues, based on both a theoretical and practical deep learning analysis of
standard pipeline and new paradigms. 

Join us to discover how energy hungry your deep learning is, and join the competition to improve it.

## Program:

**7:00 am (UTC)**
### Introduction on Low Power deep learning 

<img src="../images/sebastien.png" align="center" width="200"/>

**Bio** After a PHD thesis defended in 2008, at Institut de Marseille Sebastien worked as Associated professor at Université d’Angers in the lab LAREMA where he defended his Habilitation thesis in 2014. He found the AI start-up LumeanAI in 2015 and the non-profit organization IAPau in 2016. Since 2020, he is researcher at the LMAP at UPPA and found with Paul Gay the GreenAi UPPA Group. His research interest are online learning, mathematical statistics, information theory for machine learning and more recently, in the applications of these activities to deep learning techniques and environmental challenges.

Johannes Lederer

**Bio** Johannes is Professor of Mathematical Statistics at the Ruhr-University Bochum. After receiving a MSc in Physics, he completed his Doctor of Sciences at ETH Zürich. He then held positions at UC Berkeley, Cornell University, and University of Washington prior to his appointment in Bochum. His research interests include high-dimensional statistics, empirical process theory, and deep learning.

Guillaume Bellec

**bio** Guillaume Bellec develops theories to advance our under-standing of brains and intelligent machines. He studied artificial intelligence during his Master in Paris and he completed his PhD with Wolfgang Maass in the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science of TU Graz in Austria. He is now a postdoc with Wulfram Gerstner in the Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience at EPFL in Switzerland. His work is most well-known for showing that powerful artificial intelligence can emerge from simple mathematical models of biologically realistic neural networks. This work is having a direct impact on the development of neuromorphic-hardware for energy efficient artificial intelligence applications.

Green AI Team Tutorial: Energy consumption of AI

**bio** Paul Gay is a researcher engineer at the LMAP. He obtained his phd at the université of maine (https://lium.univ-lemans.fr/) in 2014 on unsupervised Audio-visual person identification in broadcast data. Then, he went through a teaching period at the [LIA](https://lia.univ-avignon.fr/) (2015) a Post-doc in computer vision, at [IIT/PAVIS](https://pavis.iit.it/) (2016 - 2018), and worked at the [LumenAI](https://www.lumenai.fr/) on community detection (2019 - 2020).

**Competition results**

The winners will be announced, and the more promising approaches will be described as well general feedbacks about the competition and some lesssons we'll have learned about measuring the hungriness of Deep learning and what we can do about it.  


## Call for papers

We invite contributions to the 2021 workshop on power efficient deep learning, and welcome paper submissions on artificial intelligence, power consumption, AI carbon footprint and related areas.

Candidates must submit a two page proposal on the topic of their intervention. Top contributions will be selected by a board of reviewers, and they will be chosen to present their work at the workshop.


Key dates:
- 05/11/2021 Submission date
- 12/11/2021 End of reviewing period and final decisions
- 17/11/2021 Workshop date


All participants are encouraged to share some material, in order to facilitate interactions during the live sessions. If you are too shy to send a video or a poster, consider sharing some slides describing your research interests in connection to the workshop topic. You can also send us a link to a paper or to some code, and we update this information in the program.
