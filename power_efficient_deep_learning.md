Measure of consumption, light environmental impact, in this workshop, we expect to address these issues, based on both a theoretical and practical deep learning analysis of
standard pipeline and new paradigms. Join us to discover how energy hungry your deep learning is, and join the competition to improve it.



## Program:

**9:00 am (CTU)**

Abstract on the power deep learning survey intervention

**Bio** After a PHD thesis defended in 2008, at Institut de Marseille Sebastien worked as Associated professor at Université d’Angers in the lab LAREMA where he defended his Habilitation thesis in 2014. He found the AI start-up LumeanAI in 2015 and the non-profit organization IAPau in 2016. Since 2020, he is researcher at the LMAP at UPPA and found with Paul Gay the GreenAi UPPA Group. His research interest are online learning, mathematical statistics, information theory for machine learning and more recently, in the applications of these activities to deep learning techniques and environmental challenges.
